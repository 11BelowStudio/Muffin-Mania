### SUPER HELPFUL INFORMATIVE TIPS
* You only score points by eating muffins
    * Yes, you need to defend your muffin machine, by throwing muffins at the attackers.
    * But what's the point in having muffins if you can't eat them?
* You score more points if you eat multiple muffins in a row (without stopping to throw a muffin)
* Your muffin supply will gradually refill over time if you have less than 10 muffins on hand
    * But don't let yourself get caught short, unable to defend yourself!
