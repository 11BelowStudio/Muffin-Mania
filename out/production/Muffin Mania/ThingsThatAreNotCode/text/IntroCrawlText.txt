In the grim darkness of the far future
there is only cake.

Ever since the Cupcake Cult asserted
dominance over the world,
every other form of baked produce has gone extinct,
deemed heretical and 'not very nice tasting'.

Well, that's what they want you to think.

Some people still secretly bake their own,
homemade, baked goods.
Some people do it for the money,
others keep it for themselves.

The Cupcake Cult are aware of this,
and send in legions of CupcakeBots,
primed to destroy these blasphemous bakeries.

Many have fought valiantly against the cult,
but very few have lived to tell the tale.
No mercy is shown to the bakers
who dare to oppose the Cupcake Cult.

For, in this grim darkness,
there can only be cake.

You are one such blasphemous baker,
with a machine that can produce infinite muffins.

But the Cupcake Cult are onto you.

In these situations, there is only one thing to do.
You can't run, and you can't hide.
All you can do is eat as many muffins as you can,
whilst you still can...
